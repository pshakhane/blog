  <h2>Traditional VS Digital Marketing</h2>
  <p>Retention of customers and understanding their satisfaction can measure the value of an organization. For example, Amazon, Google, and Netflix have transformed the playing field of marketing in the last decade through the generation, provision, and utilization of big data. Acceleration of solutions to link customersâ€™ data across online and offline channels and across television, tablet, mobile, and other digital devices further contribute to the availability of data. There are several reasons why customers change providers. These include availability of other providers, inappropriate management of customer data, insufficient services, multiple attractive offers, and customers dissatisfaction with the service.</p><button>like</button>
